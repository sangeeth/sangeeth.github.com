Welcome to my space. Like many software developers, I gained most of my knowledge from the web.
Now, I believe it is my responsibility to share my experience with various technologies which I use, learn and develop.
I hope I do justice to my thought.

After several years of search, I finally found the most suitable technology to publish my thoughts.
Right, this site is powered by <a title="A static, minimalist CMS" href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> and <a title="Social Coding" href="http://github.com">Github</a> !
