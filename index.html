<h1>Welcome</h1>

<p>
Welcome to my space. Like many software developers, I gained most of my knowledge from the web.
Now, I believe it is my responsibility to share my experience with various technologies which I use, learn and develop.
I hope I do justice to my thought.
</p>

<p>
After several years of search, I finally found the most suitable technology to publish my thoughts.
Right, this site is powered by <a title="A static, minimalist CMS" href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> and <a title="Social Coding" href="http://github.com">Github</a> !
<p>

<p>
Apologies for some incomplete posts.
Just recently, I started with Jekyll and kind of settled with it.  
I'm actively migrating contents from my <a href="http://www.sangeethlabs.com/cms/">old site</a> to here.
And also pushing my projects and code written in various languages to <a href="http://github.com/sangeeth">my Github account</a>.
